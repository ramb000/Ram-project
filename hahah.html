    <p>Ive been interessted in Basketball for about 5-6 years. It started in elementary school when me and my friends would play after school. Ever since then I've been practiceing, Ive been on multiple teams. I've played on AUU teams and my school teams. I am planning on tryingout in High School. I also play NBA 2k which is a video game and I watch the NBA alot. My favorite player is Lebron James and my favorite teams are the Celtics and Lakers. I've played 2k since 2k14 which is 5 years.

    	<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">GAMING</span></h5>

    	<p>Gaming has always been something that I can do when I need to relax. I've been playing video games for 8-9 years, my first system that I really played with was a Playstation 2. I played games on the PS2 like gta san Andrea, Star Wars Force Unleashed, SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Star Wars: Battlefront II, and God Of War. I eventally got a ps3, after playing that for a few years I got my current system PS4. I've become pretty serious with gaming. Now Iplay games such as NBA 2k, Fornite, Call Of Duty, Tom clancy, Madden, and Battlefront. I think I'm getting better as time go on.
