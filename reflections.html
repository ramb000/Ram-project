<p>I learned that all the norms we made in class today are expected to be followed. I also learned that if some of the norms are broken there will be consequences, the consequences will be either 15 push ups or 30 push ups depending on what you did. There will be a lot of homework and there will be many ways to earn money. I also learned what type of coding we will be learning.</p>
